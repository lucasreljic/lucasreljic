### Hi there 👋

I'm Lucas, 

A long time robotics enthusiast, starting at age 11 I was a member of a junior engineering club called Roots2Stem. I continually worked on various projects with my last project, an electric gokart, my greatest accomplishment there. Since then, I have gone through 5 years of FIRST Robotics, becoming the programming lead for my school's team and in the final year given the role of team captain. Recently, I spent 8 months working on a humanoid robot for GoodLabs Studio.

here is a little more about me...
